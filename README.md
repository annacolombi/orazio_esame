In this project, there are the annotations of four poems by Horace, produced by automatic annotation models.
The poems are: Odes I.32, Odes I.11, Odes I.23, and Odes III.30.
The folders contain the annotations, respectively, of:
	•	Horace Perseus: annotated using the Perseus model through the online UDPipe tool
	•	Horace Proiel: annotated using the Proiel model through the online UDPipe tool
	•	Horace Stanza: annotated using the Stanza model via a Google Colab script

The annotations were performed using the online UDPipe tool for the first two models, and a Google Colab script for Stanza.
